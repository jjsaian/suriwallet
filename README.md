<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Holder Repository

The Holder Repository is a wallet platform for resellers to view all of their VCs that have been issued by pharmaceutical companies. They can then use the interface to share their VCs (in this case, to the Pharma's League marketplace) for validation and identification as an authorized reseller on the platform.

## About The Project

Pharma's League uses Affinidi's verifiable credentials to build a unified and trusted marketplace to combat the massive online trade in counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

#### Rise in Couterfeit Pharmaceuticals

<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the fast-paced world of e-commerce has taken the acceleration of selling pharmaceuticals online to the next level.</p>
<p>Though 60% of pharmaceutical brands have seen an increase of revenue from their online business, they also have suffered an increase of 67% in online counterfeits as a result. WHO estimates that counterfeit medicines worth 89 billion USD are traded annually.</p> 
<p>Multiple news articles have been published about the increasingly prevalent issue:</p>

#### Affected Communities
<p>Counterfeit drugs affect people from poor, underprivileged communities most, where self-medication is most common.</p>
<p>Half of the deaths from the current opioid crisis were from the synthetic heroin fentanyl, which was reported to contain counterfeit medications.</p>
<p>Fake COVID-19 vaccines have been identified in Mexico, Poland, and many other countries.</p>


#### Pharma's League's Mission

<p>We aim to prevent further harm caused towards these communities. This is done by offering a single source of truth for the purchase and reselling of drugs online, where resellers have to be authorized by respective pharmas to resell their drugs. The guarantee of trust between buyers and sellers would also enforce a more efficient pharma market.</p>
